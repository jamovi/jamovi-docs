Common Data Recipes
===================

This section provides common data recipes for handling and transforming data in jamovi, such as excluding outliers, reverse scoring survey items, recoding continuous variables to categories, and more.


Excluding Outliers (IQR)
------------------------

Two common approaches for identifying and removing outliers are the IQR method and the Z-score method.

For the IQR method, values that are greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile or below the first quartile are considered outliers (of course more strict or lenient thresholds can be applied).
Any values outside this range should be filtered out of an analysis, see `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range#Outliers>`__ for more info.

For example, the data below has two columns one for Memory Score Performance and another for the Absolute IQR of the Memory Score Performance variable.
The last two rows of the data show extreme outlier values of 15 and 98 for Memory Score Performance, which have Absolute IQR values of 9.05 and 5.05 respectively, indicating that they are outside the whiskers of a boxplot and should be filtered out of analyses.


    .. list-table:: Memory Scores Pre Filtering (ABSIQR) for Outliers
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Memory_Score
        - ABSIQR(Memory_Score)
      * - 68
        - 0
      * - 66
        - 0
      * - 70
        - 0
      * - ...
        - ...
      * - 15
        - 9.05
      * - 98
        - 5.05

To exclude these outliers from analyses, a filter can be created using the ABSIQR() function in the filter expression:
``ABSIQR(Memory_Score)<1.5``

This filter will include only those rows where the Absolute IQR value is less than 1.5 and thererfore exclude the outliers greater than or equal to 1.5:

    .. list-table:: Memory Scores Post Filtering (ABSIQR) for Outliers
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Filter 1
        - Memory_Score
        - ABSIQR(Memory_Score)
      * - ✔
        - 68
        - 0
      * - ✔
        - 66
        - 0
      * - ✔
        - 70
        - 0
      * - ✔
        - ...
        - ...
      * - ✘
        - 15
        - 9.05
      * - ✘
        - 98
        - 5.05

As shown above, the filter has excluded the two outliers (15 and 98) with an additional column with crosses to indicate exclusion (excluded rows will also appear as grey/transparent in the data view).
Only the non-outlier values (68, 66, 70, etc.) are included in analyses and visualisations, as indicated by ticks in the first column above.


Excluding Outliers (Z-Score)
----------------------------
For the Z-score method, often values that have a z-score +/- 3 are considered outliers and removed for analyses (more lenient or strict thresholds can be applied).

For example, below is a data set with a column for Memory Score Performance and another for the Absolute Z-Score of the Memory Score Performance variable.

    .. list-table:: Memory Scores Pre Filtering (ABSZ) for Outliers
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Memory_Score
        - ABSZ(Memory_Score)
      * - 68
        - 1.08
      * - 66
        - 0.93
      * - 70
        - 1.23
      * - ...
        - ...
      * - 15
        - 3.01
      * - 98
        - 3.43


The last two rows of the data show outlier values of 15 and 98 for Memory Score Performance, which have Absolute Z-Score values of 3.01 and 3.43 respectively, indicating that they are outliers and should be filtered out of analyses.
To exclude the rows with outliers, the following filter can be used:
``ABSZ(Memory_Score)<3``

    .. list-table:: Memory Scores Post Filtering (ABSZ) for Outliers
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Filter 1
        - Memory_Score
        - ABSZ(Memory_Score)
      * - ✔
        - 68
        - 1.08
      * - ✔
        - 66
        - 0.93
      * - ✔
        - 70
        - 1.23
      * - ✔
        - ...
        - ...
      * - ✘
        - 15
        - 3.01
      * - ✘
        - 98
        - 3.43

As shown above, the filter has excluded the two outliers (15 and 98) with an additional column with crosses to indicate exclusion (excluded rows will also appear as grey/transparent in the data view).
Only the non-outlier values (68, 66, 70, etc.) are included in analyses and visualisations, as indicated by ticks in the first column above.


Reverse Scoring Survey Items
----------------------------
When handling survery data, it is common to have some items that are reverse scored.
A simple rule of thumb for reverse scoring is to subtract the item score from the maximum possible score plus one.

For example, below is a table of data in which participants have responded on a 1-7 Likert scale to three items (Item_1, Item_2, and Item_3) that are intended to measure the same construct, but Item_3 is scored such that higher scores indicate less of the construct being measured.

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Reverse Scoring Survey Item
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Item_1
         - Item_2
         - Item_3
       * - 4
         - 3
         - 3
       * - 3
         - 4
         - 5
       * - 4
         - 4
         - 2


To reverse score Item_3, click a new column and choose `New Computed Variable` and use the following:
``8 - Item_3``
Alternatively, if reverse scoring needs to be applied to multiple items, click a new column and choose `New Transformed Variable`, choose the item to be reverse score in the Source variable box.
Next click, using transformation and choose `Create New Transform...` and use the following formula:
``8 - $SOURCE``


    .. list-table:: Data Post-Reverse Scoring Survey Item
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Item_1
        - Item_2
        - Item_3
        - Item_3_Reverse_Scored
      * - 4
        - 3
        - 3
        - 4
      * - 3
        - 4
        - 6
        - 1
      * - 4
        - 4
        - 2
        - 5

Once applied the new column (Item_3_Reverse_Scored) will contain the reverse scored values (of Item_3), values of 1 become 7, values of 2 become 6, values of 3 become 5, and so on.
Now higher scores on Item_3_Reverse_Scored indicate more of the construct being measured and lower scores indicate less of the construct being measured, which is consistent with the scoring of Item_1 and Item_2.
This is a particularly important step to ensure that all items are scored in the same direction before computing a sum score or mean score across items, otherwise the resulting overall score may not accurately reflect the construct being measured.

Attention Checks with a Reverse Scored Item
---------------------------------------------

Often two items in a survery that ask a similar question but are worded in opposite directions, one is reverse worded and the other is not, can be used as an attention check by comparing responses on both.
Participants who fail to respond in a consistent way to these two items are likely not paying attention or responding in a biased way (e.g., acquiescent response bias, random response bias).

For example, Item 1: “I never doubt my abilities.” and Item 2: “I often doubt my abilities.” should result in participants responding in a consistent way (i.e., if they strongly agree (5) with Item 1, they should also strongly disagree (1) with Item 2):

    .. list-table:: Attention Check with Reverse Scoring Step 1.
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Item_1
        - Item_2
        - Item_2_Reverse_Scored
      * - 5
        - 1
        - 5
      * - 1
        - 5
        - 1
      * - 1
        - 2
        - 3

To check if participants are consistently responding to the two items, take the reverse scored version of Item_2 (Item_2_Reverse_Scored) and compare it to Item_1, the absolute difference between should be 0 if participants are responding in a consistent way, and any value greater than 0 indicates inconsistency in responses between the two items.

To do this, first reverse score the item that is reverse worded (in this case Item_2) using the same method as described in the previous section.

Next, in a blank column click `New Computed Variable` and use the following formula to compute the absolute difference between Item_1 and Item_2_Reverse_Scored:
``ABS(Item_1 - Item_2_Reverse_Scored)``

    .. list-table:: Attention Check with Reverse Scoring Step 2.
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Item_1
         - Item_2
         - Item_2_Reverse_Scored
         - Absolute_Difference
       * - 5
         - 1
         - 5
         - 0
       * - 1
         - 5
         - 1
         - 0
       * - 1
         - 2
         - 3
         - 2


Then under the data tab click `Filter`, here we can filter out paticipants who have an absolute difference greater than 0 by using the following filter expression:
``Absolute_Difference == 0``

    .. list-table:: Attention Check with Reverse Scoring Step 3.
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Filter 1
         - Item_1
         - Item_2
         - Item_2_Reverse_Scored
         - Absolute_Difference
       * - ✔
         - 5
         - 1
         - 5
         - 0
       * - ✔
         - 1
         - 5
         - 1
         - 0
       * - ✘
         - ...
         - ...
         - ...
         - ...

Any participants who did not respond consistenly are now removed and any only participants who responded in a consistent way to the attention check items are included in analyses and visualisations.


Attention Checks with a Single Item
---------------------------------------------
Often a particular item can be used as an attention check, it may say "Please select ‘strongly disagree’ for this item".
These items are designed to catch participants who are not paying attention or responding in a biased way (e.g., acquiescent response bias, random response bias).
This is an impossible item to fail if participants are truly paying attention.

Below are responses to several items of a survey, where item nine (Item_9_Attention_Check) is an attention check item that instructs participants to select '5' (or strongly agree) to indicate they are paying attention (from a possible 1-5 likert scale):

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Removing Response Bias Participants
      :header-rows: 1

      * - ID
        - Item_1
        - Item_2
        - Item_9_Attention_Check
      * - 1
        - 3
        - 3
        - 5
      * - 2
        - 5
        - 4
        - 5
      * - 3
        - 4
        - 4
        - 4

The last participant (ID 3) has failed the attention check by selecting Agree ('4') instead of Strongly Agree ('5') on the attention check item.

In jamovi, to remove participants who fail the attention check, click on ``Filters`` near the filter icon and use the following filter expression:
``Item_9_Attention_Check == 5``

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Removing Response Bias Participants
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Filter 1
        - ID
        - Item_1
        - Item_2
        - Item_9_Attention_Check
      * - ✔
        - 1
        - 3
        - 3
        - 5
      * - ✔
        - 2
        - 5
        - 4
        - 5
      * - ✘
        - ...
        - ...
        - ...
        - ...

Now, only the participants who have passed the attention check are included and any participants who failed the attention check are removed.


Summation (or Total) Score of Survey Items
------------------------------------------
Sum scores are often computed across multiple items of survey responses to create an overall score for a construct being measured, often to correlate with other variables or compare between conditions.
For example, personality questionnaires use multiple items to measure a single personality trait - such as Extraversion.
By computing a sum score across those survey items, an overall score (in this case Extraversion Score) can be created for each participant (see `here <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2006.02.001>`__  for more info on personality scales).

Below is a table of responses to several items of the subscale of Extraversion, where each item is scored on a 1-5 Likert scale:

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Summation of Extraversion Items
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Item_1
         - Item_6
         - Item_11
         - Item_16
       * - 5
         - 1
         - 3
         - 3
       * - 4
         - 2
         - 1
         - 1
       * - 4
         - 2
         - 4
         - 5

To compute a sum score across these items, click a new column and choose `New Computed Variable`.
By using the SUM() function and choosing the variables (or rather items) of interest, the following formula can be used to compute the sum score:
``SUM(Item_1, Item_6, Item_11, Item_16)``


    .. list-table:: Data Post-Summation of Extraversion Items
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Item_1
         - Item_6
         - Item_11
         - Item_16
         - Extraversion_Sum_Score
       * - 5
         - 1
         - 3
         - 3
         - 12
       * - 4
         - 2
         - 1
         - 1
         - 8
       * - 4
         - 2
         - 4
         - 5
         - 15


As shown above, the new column (Extraversion_Sum_Score) contains the sum score across the items (of Extraversion) with each row indicating the overall score for each participant.
This sum score can now be used in analyses and visualisations to correlate with other variables or compare between conditions.


Recoding a Continuous Variable to Categories
--------------------------------------------
Often continuous variables are recoded into categories to create groups for comparison.
Age is a common example of a continuous variable that is often recoded into categories such as Young Adults (18-29), Middle-Aged Adults (30-59), and Older Adults (60+).
Below is an example of a data set with a column for Age:

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Recoding Age to Categories
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Age
       * - 25
       * - 18
       * - 20
       * - 35
       * - 30
       * - 45
       * - 65
       * - 62
       * - 71

To recode a continuous variable, like age, into categories click on a new column and choose `New Transformed Variable`.
Next, choose the source variable to be the variable of interest (i.e. Age) and click on `Using transformation` and choose `Create New Transform...`:

|ts_recode_age|

Then click `Add recode condition` next to the blue plus sign and use the following cutoffs to recode Age into categories:

|ts_recode_age_thresholds|

In the transformation editor, you can set up the recoding logic using conditions such as:

  - If Age < 30, then assign "Young"
  - If Age < 50, then assign "Middle-Aged"
  - Else, assign "Older"

This works because the conditions are evaluated in order. For example:

* Any value less than 30 will be assigned "Young" (so ages 18–29).
* For values not less than 30, the next condition is checked: if Age < 50, assign "Middle-Aged" (so ages 30–49).
* Any value not meeting the previous conditions (i.e., 50 and above) will be assigned "Older" by the final else statement.

This approach allows you to create non-overlapping, ordered Age categories using simple less-than conditions and a final catch-all else.

A new column will appear next to the data, with the recoded categories of Age (Young, Middle-Aged, and Older) based on the cutoffs specified in the transformation:

    .. list-table:: Data Post-Recoding Age to Categories
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Age
         - Age_Categories
       * - 25
         - Young
       * - 18
         - Young
       * - 20
         - Young
       * - 35
         - Middle-Aged
       * - 30
         - Middle-Aged
       * - 45
         - Middle-Aged
       * - 65
         - Older
       * - 62
         - Older
       * - 71
         - Older

This new categorical variable can now be used in analyses and visualisations to compare between Age groups.


Recoding/Reducing the Number of Categories
-------------------------------------------
Often categorical variables have many categories, and it can be useful to recode or reduce the number of categories for more simple analysis or visualisation.
Smoker status is a common example of this, smoker status could be either; Non-smoker, Occasional Smoker, Regular Smoker, or Heavy Smoker:

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Reducing Smoker Status to Categories
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Smoker_Status
       * - Non-smoker
       * - Occasional Smoker
       * - Regular Smoker
       * - Heavy Smoker

Reducing these categories to two, Non-smoker and Smoker, can be useful for simple comparisons between Smokers and Non-smokers.
To reduce the number of categories, click on a new column and choose `New Transformed Variable`.
Next, choose the source variable to be the variable of interest (i.e. Smoker_Status) and click on `Using transformation` and choose `Create New Transform...`.

Non-smokers can be left as is, while the other categories can be combined into a single "Smoker" category.
The following recoding logic can be applied to reduce the number of categories:

|ts_reduce_smoker_status|

A new column will appear next to the data, with the recoded categories of Smoker Status (Non-smoker and Smoker):

    .. list-table:: Data Post-Reducing Smoker Status to Categories
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Smoker_Status
         - Smoker_Status_Reduced
       * - Non-smoker
         - Non-smoker
       * - Occasional Smoker
         - Smoker
       * - Regular Smoker
         - Smoker
       * - Heavy Smoker
         - Smoker

The new column of data, Smoker_Status_Reduced, can now be used in analyses and visualisations to compare between Smokers and Non-smokers.


Restricting Analyses to a Subset of Data
-----------------------------------------
At times only a subset of data is needed for an analysis, it may be useful to restrict the data to a subset of interest.
In jamovi to restrict any analyses to a single group this is as simple as applying a `Filter`.

A Filter can be used to restrict the data to only the rows of interest - which is best used if the other subset of data is of no interest and can be excluded from all analyses (see the following section if interested in keeping subsets and splitting output via categories).

Below is an example of a data set with three variables, Region, Education Level, and Total Survey Score:

    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Filtering to Analyse a Subset of Data
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Region
         - Education Level
         - Total Survey Score
       * - North America
         - High School
         - 15
       * - North America
         - University
         - 20
       * - Europe
         - High School
         - 10
       * - Europe
         - University
         - 25
       * - North America
         - High School
         - 12
       * - Europe
         - University
         - 22

Perhaps there is interest in comparing the Total Survey Score of participants between Education Levels, but only for participants from North America (and exclude any from Europe).

To do so, a filter (option 2) to the overall data set is best suited, click on the data tab and select `Filters` under the filter icon, then use the following expression:
``Region == 'North America'``

    .. list-table:: Data Post-Filtering to Analyse a Subset of Data (Option 2)
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Filter 1
         - Region
         - Education Level
         - Total Survey Score
       * - ✔
         - North America
         - High School
         - 15
       * - ✔
         - North America
         - University
         - 20
       * - ✘
         - ...
         - ...
         - ...
       * - ✘
         - ...
         - ...
         - ...
       * - ✔
         - North America
         - High School
         - 12
       * - ✘
         - ...
         - ...
         - ...

A new column will appear with ticks to indicate which rows are included and crosses to indicate which rows are excluded.
jamovi will now only consider participants from North America (or rather rows with ticks) for any analyses and visualisations.


Anlaysing Subsets of Data (AKA Split File)
--------------------------------------------
It can be useful to analyse two or more subsets of data separately, this is often referred to as a `Split File` in other statistical software.

Below is an example of a data set with three variables, Region, Education Level, and Total Survey Score.
    .. list-table:: Data Pre-Filtering to Analyse a Subset of Data
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Region
         - Education Level
         - Total Survey Score
       * - North America
         - High School
         - 15
       * - North America
         - University
         - 20
       * - Europe
         - High School
         - 10
       * - Europe
         - University
         - 25
       * - North America
         - High School
         - 12
       * - Europe
         - University

Perhaps there is interest in comparing the Total Survey Score of participants between Education Levels, but want to analyse or rather split output via geographical location North America and Europe separately.
Such data handling can be achieved in jamovi, although currently there is a lack of simple functionality to split the output of analyses by a category and requires a somewhat round about approach to achieve this.

To begin, two New Computed Variables need to be created.
The first must filter to only include participants from North America.
To do this, click on a new column and choose `New Computed Variable`, give it a name (e.g., `Total_Survey_Score_NorthAm`) and use the following formula:
``FILTER(`Total Survey Score`, Region == 'North America')``

The new data column (`Total_Survey_Score_NorthAm``) contains Total Survey Scores only for participants from North America, with missing values assigned to participants from other countries, allowing it to be used in analyses and visualisations comparing Education Levels among North American participants while excluding participants from Europe:

    .. list-table:: Data Mid-Filtering to Analyse Subsets of Data
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Region
         - Education Level
         - Total Survey Score
         - Total_Survey_Score_NorthAm
       * - North America
         - High School
         - 15
         - 15

         - 20
       * - Europe

         - 12
       * - Europe
         - University
         - 22
         -



The second New Computed Variable must filter to only include participants from Europe.
To do this, click on a new column and choose `New Computed Variable`, give it a name (e.g., `Total_Survey_Score_Europe`) and use the following formula:
``FILTER(`Total Survey Score`, Region == 'Europe')``

    .. list-table:: Data Post-Filtering to Analyse Subsets of Data
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Region
         - Education Level
         - Total Survey Score
         - Total_Survey_Score_NorthAm
         - Total_Survey_Score_Europe
       * - North America
         - High School

       * - Europe
         - High School
         - 10
         -
         - 10
       * - Europe
         - University
         - 25
         -
         - 25
       * - North America

       * - Europe
         - University
         - 22
         -
         - 22


Using the new columns of data (Total_Survey_Score_NorthAm and Total_Survey_Score_Europe), the same analyses can be run to compare between Education Levels for participants from North America and Europe separately using the respective columns of data.


String Concatenation
--------------------
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings of text together to create a new string.
Categorical variables are often represented as strings of text, and sometimes it can be useful to combine information from multiple categorical variables into a single variable.

For example, here are two variables Condition and Time:

    .. list-table:: Pre-String Concatenation Example
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Participant_ID
         - Condition
         - Time
       * - 1
         - Control
         - Pre
       * - 1
         - Control
         - Post
       * - 2
         - Therapy
         - Pre
       * - 2
         - Therapy
         - Post
       * - 3
         - Control
         - Pre
       * - 3
         - Therapy
         - Post

Combining the information from both Condition and Time can be a simple way to represent the different conditions and time points in a single variable.

To do this, click on a new column and choose `New Computed Variable`, give it a name (e.g., `Condition_Time`) and use the following formula:
``Condition + '_' + Time``


    .. list-table:: Post-String Concatenation Example
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Participant_ID
         - Condition
         - Time
         - Condition_Time
       * - 1
         - Control
         - Pre
         - Control_Pre
       * - 1
         - Control
         - Post
         - Control_Post
       * - 2
         - Therapy
         - Pre
         - Therapy_Pre
       * - 2
         - Therapy
         - Post
         - Therapy_Post
       * - 3
         - Control
         - Pre
         - Control_Pre
       * - 3
         - Therapy
         - Post
         - Therapy_Post

The new Condition_Time variable contains the combined information from both Condition and Time, with an underscore used to separate the two pieces of information (note this underscore can be excluded if desired).
This new variable can now be used in analyses and visualisations to compare between the different conditions and time points in a more simple way than having to consider both Condition and Time separately.


Date Handling
-------------

Date handling in jamovi is currently fairly limited. There is no 'native' Date data type at this time (one is planned however). The following describes a number of date manipulations that are available.

There are two useful date functions, ``DATEVALUE()`` and ``DATE()``, that can be used with :ref:`computed-variables`. ``DATEVALUE()`` converts a date string such as ``2025-01-29`` to an integer representing the number of days since January 1st, 1970. ``DATE()`` performs the opposite transformation, converting such an integer into a date string. A useful way to use these functions is to first convert the date to an integer, perform some computation, and then convert the result back to a date string. Both functions optionally take a date format string if using a particular format.

    .. list-table:: Example date formatting
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Day
        - ``DATE(Day)``
        - ``DATE(Day, "%d %m %Y")``
        - ``DATE(Day, "%m/%d/%y")``
      * - 13
        - 1970-01-13
        - 13 01 1970
        - 01/13/81
      * - 4197
        - 1981-06-29
        - 29 06 1981
        - 06/29/81

Computing a date in the future
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example converts a date to an integer, adds 7 (representing 7 days), and then converts it back to a date string.

    .. list-table:: Adding 7 days to a date
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Date
        - ``DATEVALUE(Date)``
        - ``DATEVALUE(Date) + 7``
        - ``DATE(DATEVALUE(Date) + 7)``
      * - 2026-01-29
        - 20482
        - 20489
        - 2026-02-05
      * - 2024-03-10
        - 19792
        - 19799
        - 2024-03-17
      * - 2025-08-22
        - 20322
        - 20329
        - 2025-08-29

Computing days elapsed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. list-table:: Computing days elapsed
      :header-rows: 1

      * - StartDate
        - EndDate
        - ``DATEVALUE(EndDate) - DATEVALUE(StartDate)``
      * - 2026-01-29
        - 2026-02-15
        - 17
      * - 2024-03-10
        - 2024-04-11
        - 32
      * - 2025-08-22
        - 2024-04-11
        - -498

Extracting month, year, or day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``SPLIT()`` function can be used to extract the year, month, or day of month, from a date string. The ``SPLIT()`` function takes a text value (such as a date string), splits it into chunks using the second argument as the delimeter, and returns the nth chunk, determined by the third argument. Note that ``SPLIT()`` returns a text value, which will needs to be converted to an integer (with the ``INT()`` function) if to be used in arithmetic.

    .. list-table:: Extracting month, year, or day
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Date
        - ``SPLIT(Date, '-', 1)``
        - ``SPLIT(Date, '-', 2)``
        - ``SPLIT(Date, '-', 3)``
      * - 2026-01-29
        - 2026
        - 01
        - 29
      * - 2024-03-10
        - 2024
        - 03
        - 10
      * - 2025-08-22
        - 2025
        - 08
        - 22
