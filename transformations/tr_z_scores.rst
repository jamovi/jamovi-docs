==========================
z-score Transformation
==========================

-  | .
   | In the formula editor, you can use the ``ZSCORE()`` function to calculate z-scores for a variable.
   | For example, to calculate z-scores for the variable ``score``, enter:

   .. code-block:: text

      ZSCORE(score)

   | You can give the new variable a name, such as ``score_z``.

-  | The z-score transformation standardizes your variable, so it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
   | This is useful for comparing variables measured on different scales.
