Transformations Overview
=========================

   The aim of this section is to provide users a short guide on conducting common data transformations in jamovi.
   This guide is designed for users who understand the concept of data transformations but are unsure how to perform them in jamovi.
   Below we provide a brief description of each data transformation covered in this section (alongside links for further details).

z-score transformation
----------------------

    
    In short, a z-score is the number of standard deviations a raw value is from the overall mean of the variable being measured.
    The z-score transformation standardises your variable, so it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    Calculating a z-score is useful for comparing variables measured on different scales and for identifying outliers in your data *add ref here*..

    Thankfully jamovi has made calculating a z-score for an entire column of data a seamless process, for a step-by-step guide see :doc:`tr_z_scores`.
